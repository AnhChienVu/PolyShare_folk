Installation is a straight forward non persistent process
# Windows,
run the executable in any directory/folder and
polyshare will create a folder called "shared_files" there,
any files in the "shared_files" folder will become sharable.
you can also add files to the folder by uploading via browser interface.

# On Linux and macOS:
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory where your executable (polyShare) is located.
Before running it, make sure the executable has the correct permissions. Run the following command to give it executable permissions:
```
chmod +x polyShare-preview
```
Run the executable.
